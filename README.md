Very Stupid (static) Website Generator

This library lets you create a custom static website generator from scratch.

## Motivation

Zola is a great static website generator, but it forces you to use its own template language. I wanted a more flexible solution, so I created this library.

Goals:
- follow the KISS principles
- be flexible
Non goals:
- be fast
- use markdown (users can use a markdown crate if they want)

You can find example usage in the [`examples`](./examples/) directory.
